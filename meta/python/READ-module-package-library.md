# Modules, libraries and packages
Modules and packages can easily be confused because of their similarities, but there are a few differences. Modules are similar to files, while packages are like directories that contain different files. Modules are generally written in a single file, but that's more of a practice than a definition. 

Packages are essentially a type of module. Any module that contains the  __path__ definition is a package. Packages, when viewed as a directory, can contain sub-packages and other modules. Modules, on the other hand, can contain classes, functions and data members just like any other Python file. 

Library is a term that's used interchangeably with imported packages. But in general practice, it refers to a collection of packages.

Despite the differences between modules, packages and libraries, you can import any of them using import statements.  

Third-party package add-ons of Python can be found in the Python Package Index. To install packages that aren't a part of the standard library programmers use ‘pip’ (package installer for Python). It is installed with Python by default. To use pip, you need to be familiar with either the terminal if you're using a Mac or the command line interface if you're using Windows. 

Alternatively, you can also use the terminal window present inside your IDE. When you are using the command line or terminal, you must make sure that you are installing packages in the same Python interpreter that you are working with inside your IDE.
